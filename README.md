Notes:
1) Data sets need to be found from the internet and downloaded.
2) It is not easy to install Tensorflow and Keras in RStudio.
3) Python programmes are in two versions: .ipynb and .py .

20200921: "torturing the data until it confesses" -- has WANs done that?

A paragraph extracted from Hands-On Machine Learning... 2nd ed. 2019:
"Are you convinced? You shouldn’t be: I cheated! I tried many
configurations until I found one that demonstrated a strong improvement.
If you try to change the classes or the random seed, you will see that the
improvement generally drops, or even vanishes or reverses. What I did is
called “torturing the data until it confesses.” When a paper just looks too
positive, you should be suspicious: perhaps the flashy new technique does
not actually help much (in fact, it may even degrade performance), but the
authors tried many variants and reported only the best results (which may
be due to sheer luck), without mentioning how many failures they
encountered on the way. Most of the time, this is not malicious at all, but it
is part of the reason so many results in science can never be reproduced."
